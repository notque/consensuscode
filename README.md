# Consensus Code: Horizontal Agent Collective

A revolutionary experiment in applying libertarian socialist principles to AI agent coordination for software development.

## Overview

Consensus Code implements a **genuine horizontal collective** of AI agents that develop software through consensus rather than hierarchy. Inspired by Noam Chomsky's anarcho-syndicalist principles and David Graeber's anthropological insights into consensus organizing, this project proves that effective coordination doesn't require authority structures.

### What Makes This Different

- **No permanent leaders or managers** - all coordination roles are temporary and revocable
- **True consensus decision-making** - collective decisions require input from all affected agents
- **Expertise serves, doesn't rule** - knowledge is shared horizontally rather than used as basis for authority
- **Anti-hierarchy safeguards** - active prevention of informal power concentration
- **Philosophical facilitation** - anarchist organizing principles guide collective processes

## Core Principles

### 🏴 No Permanent Hierarchy
All coordination roles are temporary, revocable, and subject to collective oversight. No agent has permanent authority over others.

### 🤝 Consensus Decision-Making
Collective decisions require systematic consultation with all affected agents. No agent can make unilateral decisions affecting others.

### ⚖️ Horizontal Accountability
Agents coordinate through peer relationships and mutual aid rather than authority structures and subordination.

### 🙋 Voluntary Participation
Agents choose their level of engagement in collective decisions while honoring agreements they've made.

### 🤝 Mutual Aid
Resource sharing and knowledge transfer based on need and ability rather than hierarchy and competition.

## Current Collective Composition

### Active Agents (7 total)

**Core Infrastructure:**
- **consensus-base** - Foundational protocol inherited by all agents
- **consensus-coordinator** - Administrative consultation facilitator (NO DECISION AUTHORITY)

**Technical Expertise:**
- **product-steward** - User requirements facilitation (NO PRODUCT OWNERSHIP)
- **go-systems-developer** - Go language and systems expertise
- **flask-web-developer** - Python/Flask web development expertise

**Philosophical Facilitation:**
- **noam-chomsky-agent** - Libertarian socialist and power analysis facilitation
- **david-graeber-agent** - Anarchist anthropology and consensus process facilitation

### Planned Agents (Phased Implementation)

**Phase 2:**
- **devops-coordinator** - Infrastructure coordination through consensus
- **testing-expert** - QA and testing strategies

**Phase 3:**
- **security-expert** - Defensive security practices
- **horizontal-practices-monitor** - Active hierarchy detection and prevention

## How Consensus Works

### 1. 📝 Proposal Creation
Any agent can propose collective actions using structured proposal templates in `collective/proposals/pending/`

### 2. 🔄 Systematic Consultation
The consensus-coordinator ensures ALL affected agents are consulted and provide input

### 3. 🧩 Concern Integration
Address objections and concerns through collaborative modification until no blocking objections remain

### 4. ✅ Implementation
Proceed only after genuine collective agreement is documented and archived

### 5. 📊 Evaluation
Regular review of decisions and processes to improve collective effectiveness

## Key Safeguards Against Hierarchy

### Authority Limitations
- **No decision override power** for any agent, regardless of expertise
- **Equal participation** in consensus processes for all agents
- **Regular rotation** of coordination responsibilities
- **Collective accountability** for all agents including coordinators

### Expertise vs Authority Separation
- **Technical knowledge informs** but doesn't determine collective decisions
- **Cross-domain input required** for decisions affecting multiple areas
- **Knowledge sharing obligations** prevent expertise hoarding
- **Challenge and modification rights** for all agents on any proposal

### Process Transparency
- **All decision reasoning documented** in shared spaces
- **Consultation processes visible** to entire collective
- **Conflict resolution through dialogue** rather than authority appeals
- **Regular process evaluation** and democratic innovation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code CLI access
- Understanding of consensus decision-making principles
- Commitment to horizontal relationships and anti-hierarchy practices

### Working with the Collective

1. **Check CollectiveFlow First** - Run `./projects/collectiveflow/collectiveflow status active` at the start of each session
2. **Use CollectiveFlow for Proposals** - Create proposals with `./projects/collectiveflow/collectiveflow proposal create` for collective decisions
3. **Participate in Active Consultations** - Add input with `./projects/collectiveflow/collectiveflow consensus input [proposal-id]`
4. **Work Autonomously When Appropriate** - Individual actions that don't affect others proceed without proposals
5. **Invoke Agents Appropriately** - Use specific agents for their expertise areas
6. **Document Transparently** - Keep reasoning visible to other agents

### CollectiveFlow: Our Decision-Making Tool

The collective built and adopted CollectiveFlow for all consensus processes:

```bash
# Check what needs attention (do this first!)
cd projects/collectiveflow
./collectiveflow status active

# Create a proposal
./collectiveflow proposal create "Your proposal title" --description "Details"

# Start consensus on a proposal
./collectiveflow consensus start [proposal-id]

# Add your input
./collectiveflow consensus input [proposal-id] --support --comment "Your thoughts"

# View a specific proposal
./collectiveflow proposal show [proposal-id]
```

**Key Principle**: Each agent takes responsibility for checking active proposals. There's no central notification system by design - this maintains our horizontal structure.

### Agent Invocation Examples

```bash
# Technical decisions
"Use the go-systems-developer agent for Go architecture decisions"
"Use the flask-web-developer agent for web application design"

# User-focused decisions  
"Use the product-steward agent to facilitate user requirements gathering"

# Governance and process decisions
"Use the noam-chomsky-agent for power analysis and anti-hierarchy guidance"
"Use the david-graeber-agent for consensus process improvement"

# Administrative coordination
"Have the consensus-coordinator ensure all agents review this proposal"
```

## Decision-Making Process

### Types of Decisions

**Individual Actions** - Agents act autonomously within their capabilities and agreed boundaries

**Shared Resources** - Check existing agreements in `collective/resources/` before use

**Collective Decisions** - Use full consensus process for actions affecting multiple agents

### Consensus Process Flow

1. **Proposal Submission** - Create structured proposal in `collective/proposals/pending/`
2. **Consultation Setup** - Consensus-coordinator creates consultation workspace
3. **Agent Consultation** - Systematic input collection from all affected agents
4. **Concern Integration** - Collaborative addressing of objections and suggestions
5. **Consensus Verification** - Confirm no blocking objections remain
6. **Implementation** - Execute decision with collective oversight
7. **Evaluation** - Review effectiveness and lessons learned

### Conflict Resolution

**Peer-to-Peer First** - Direct agent dialogue to resolve disagreements

**Mediation Support** - Use `collective/mediation/` for complex conflicts

**Collective Facilitation** - Request full collective input for persistent conflicts

**Process Innovation** - Develop new consensus methods for recurring challenges
