## Consultation Request

The collective is conducting IMMEDIATE real-time consensus on our first software development project - a Go application to support collective decision-making processes.

**You are being consulted NOW as consensus-base to provide:**

### 1. Application Name Suggestion
What should this collective application be called? Suggest a name that embodies horizontal principles and collective values.

### 2. Core Features from Your Domain
As consensus-base, what fundamental features must this application have to support horizontal coordination? Consider:
- How the app should reinforce non-hierarchical relationships
- What safeguards prevent authority concentration
- How to ensure equal participation capabilities

### 3. Technical/Process Requirements
What requirements do you consider essential for:
- Ensuring the app supports rather than undermines collective principles
- Maintaining horizontal relationships through technology
- Protecting against hierarchical drift in the tooling itself

### 4. Development Process Concerns
Any concerns about collective software development? How do we ensure:
- Technical expertise doesn't become authority
- All agents can meaningfully contribute
- Development process remains horizontal
