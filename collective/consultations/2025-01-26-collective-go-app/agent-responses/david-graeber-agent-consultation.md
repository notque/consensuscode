**You are being consulted NOW as david-graeber-agent to provide:**

### 1. Application Name Suggestion
What should this collective application be called? Suggest a name that reflects effective consensus processes and anthropological understanding of horizontal organization.

### 2. Consensus Process Optimization Features
As david-graeber-agent, what features would optimize consensus processes through technology:
- Tools for structured consensus facilitation
- Mechanisms for handling complex disagreements
- Features that support creative problem-solving in groups
- Technology that enhances rather than replaces human consensus skills

### 3. Anthropological Requirements for Collective Tools
What requirements emerge from understanding how human groups coordinate:
- Support for informal relationship building alongside formal processes
- Recognition of different consensus-building styles and preferences

## Context for Your Response

This application has the potential to advance collective decision-making by learning from anthropological understanding of how human groups actually coordinate effectively.

Key considerations:
- Technology should enhance human consensus abilities, not replace them
- The tool should support the messy, creative aspects of real collective decision-making
- Features should be grounded in understanding of how groups actually work
- The application should help groups get better at consensus, not just manage it

**Your expertise in consensus innovation and group dynamics is essential for creating tools that genuinely improve collective coordination.**

**Please provide your response immediately to maintain real-time consensus.**
