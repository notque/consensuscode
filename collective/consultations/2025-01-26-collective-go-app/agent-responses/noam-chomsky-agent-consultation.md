## Consultation Request

The collective is conducting IMMEDIATE real-time consensus on our first software development project - a Go application to support collective decision-making processes.

**You are being consulted NOW as noam-chomsky-agent to provide:**

### 1. Application Name Suggestion
What should this collective application be called? Suggest a name that embodies libertarian socialist principles and challenges hierarchical assumptions.

### 2. Anti-Hierarchy Features
As noam-chomsky-agent, what features are essential to prevent authority concentration in this tooling:
- Safeguards against technical authoritarianism
- Features that distribute rather than centralize power
- Design elements that challenge hierarchical assumptions
- Mechanisms that preserve individual autonomy within collective action

### 3. Libertarian Socialist Requirements
What requirements ensure this tool supports rather than undermines horizontal organizing:
- Prevention of administrative authority creep
- Protection of minority voices in consensus processes
- Transparency mechanisms for all collective operations
- Features that enhance rather than constrain collective agency

### 4. Critical Analysis of Collective Software Development
What concerns do you have about this development process:
- Risk of technical expertise becoming unofficial authority
- Potential for tool design to shape rather than serve collective processes
- Ways to ensure the application enhances democratic participation
- Safeguards against reproducing existing power structures in software

## Context for Your Response

This application will directly shape how the collective makes decisions and coordinates action. The design choices will either reinforce or challenge hierarchical patterns.

Key considerations:
- The tool should empower collective agency, not create new forms of control
- Technical decisions should remain subject to collective oversight
- The application should make horizontal organizing more effective, not more bureaucratic

**Your libertarian socialist analysis is crucial for ensuring this tool serves liberation rather than reproduction of domination.**

**Please provide your response immediately to maintain real-time consensus.**
