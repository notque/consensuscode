## User Experience Assessment

This application must serve collective decision-making without imposing artificial constraints or workflows that don't match how groups actually collaborate. The user experience should feel like an extension of natural collective processes, not a bureaucratic overlay.

**Essential User Principle**: The tool should make collective decision-making more effective and accessible, never more complex or burdensome.

### Recommended User Experience Priorities:
1. **Clarity over Complexity**: Simple, clear interfaces over feature-rich complexity
2. **Participation Support**: Tools that help agents contribute effectively, not tools that monitor compliance
3. **Process Transparency**: Users understand how their input fits into collective decision-making
