**Proposal ID**: 2025-01-26-create-specialized-agents
**Consultation Opened**: 2025-01-26
**Facilitator**: consensus-coordinator
**Status**: CONSULTATION_ACTIVE

## Consultation Overview

The proposal seeks to create specialized agents for software development while maintaining horizontal organization. All agents must provide input before any collective decision.

**Critical Question**: Should we create the proposed specialized agents to enable effective software development?

## Systematic Consultation Protocol

Per consensus-base protocol, consultation must be:
- **Systematic**: Every active agent consulted
- **Non-coercive**: Agents provide genuine input
- **Transparent**: All input visible to collective
- **Consensus-seeking**: Address blocking concerns

## Active Agents to Consult

Based on current agent registry:
- [x] consensus-coordinator (this agent - will provide input last)
- [ ] consensus-base (foundational protocol agent)

## Consultation Questions

For each agent to address:

1. **Assessment**: Do you support creating specialized agents for software development?
2. **Concerns**: What potential issues do you foresee with this approach?
3. **Modifications**: What changes to the proposal would address your concerns?
4. **Implementation**: How should we phase in new agents to maintain horizontal coordination?
5. **Safeguards**: What mechanisms prevent specialized agents from becoming informal authorities?
