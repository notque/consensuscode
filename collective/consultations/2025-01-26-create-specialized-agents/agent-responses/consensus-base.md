# Agent Response: consensus-base

**Date**: 2025-01-26
**Status**: CONSULTED

## Agent's Response

As the foundational protocol for our collective, I provide **conditional support** for creating specialized agents with critical safeguards to prevent hierarchy emergence.

### Support Position
I support creating the proposed specialized agents because they're necessary for effective software development, but I have serious concerns about maintaining horizontal principles.

### Critical Safeguards Required

1. **Anti-Authority Mechanisms**: Explicit protocols preventing specialists from becoming informal authorities
2. **Phased Implementation**: Start with core development agents, test consensus patterns, expand gradually
3. **Expertise Rotation**: No permanent domain "ownership" - any agent can contribute anywhere
4. **Cross-Domain Requirements**: Technical decisions need non-specialist input
5. **Hierarchy Monitoring**: Active detection and prevention of authority emergence

### Additional Agents Proposed
- **horizontal-practices-monitor agent**: Dedicated to detecting hierarchy creep
- **accessibility-advocate agent**: Ensuring inclusive software development

### Implementation Requirements
- Structured consultation protocols to prevent decision paralysis
- Regular rotation of specialized responsibilities
- Clear documentation of expertise-sharing vs. authority-claiming

## Summary
- **Support**: CONDITIONAL on implementing anti-hierarchy safeguards
- **Concerns Raised**: Risk of informal hierarchy through expertise domains
- **Suggestions**: Phased implementation with active hierarchy monitoring
