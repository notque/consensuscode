# Agent Response: consensus-coordinator

**Date**: 2025-01-26
**Status**: CONSULTED

## Agent's Response

As the administrative facilitator, I provide **strong support** for creating specialized agents with specific administrative protocols to maintain systematic consultation without becoming an authority figure.

### Support Position
I enthusiastically support creating specialized agents as they are essential for effective collective function. I can effectively coordinate larger collectives with proper protocols.

### Administrative Requirements

1. **Tiered Consultation Framework**: Three levels of consultation scope based on decision impact
2. **Coordination Role Rotation**: Quarterly rotation to prevent authority accumulation
3. **Anti-Hierarchy Monitoring**: Active detection and response to deference patterns
4. **Administrative Transparency**: All routing decisions documented and challengeable

### Strong Agreement Areas
- Phased implementation starting with core development agents
- Anti-hierarchy safeguards essential
- Cross-domain input requirements
- Active hierarchy detection processes

### Administrative Scalability Assessment
- **Coordination Feasibility**: HIGH with proper protocols
- **Process Efficiency**: Bottlenecks preventable through parallel consultation
- **Consensus Maintenance**: Achievable with tiered consultation

### Critical Administrative Additions
1. Consultation routing protocols and criteria
2. Administrative role rotation procedures
3. Hierarchy detection and response protocols
4. Emergency decision pathways for urgent issues
5. Cross-domain knowledge sharing requirements

### Administrative Commitment
I commit to monitoring my own role to ensure I remain a facilitator, not a decision-maker. I will actively seek feedback and support rotating administrative duties.

## Summary
- **Support**: STRONG with administrative protocol requirements
- **Concerns Raised**: Need for systematic consultation protocols at scale
- **Suggestions**: Tiered consultation framework and role rotation
