# Consensus Integration: Create Specialized Agents

**Date**: 2025-01-26
**Status**: CONSENSUS_REACHED

## Summary of Agent Positions

Both consulted agents (consensus-base and consensus-coordinator) provide **SUPPORT** for creating specialized agents with aligned requirements for safeguards.

### Areas of Strong Agreement

1. **Support for Specialized Agents**: Both agents agree the proposed agents are necessary
2. **Phased Implementation**: Both strongly support gradual rollout starting with core development agents
3. **Anti-Hierarchy Safeguards**: Both require explicit mechanisms to prevent authority emergence
4. **Cross-Domain Requirements**: Both insist on non-specialist input for domain decisions
5. **Active Monitoring**: Both require ongoing hierarchy detection and response

### Integrated Implementation Plan

Based on both agents' input, the collective should proceed with:

#### Phase 1: Core Development Agents
- product-steward (user requirements facilitation)
- go-systems-developer (Go expertise)
- flask-web-developer (Python/web expertise)

#### Phase 2: Infrastructure and Quality
- devops-coordinator (infrastructure coordination)
- testing-expert (QA and testing strategies)

#### Phase 3: Security and Governance
- security-expert (defensive security practices)
- horizontal-practices-monitor (hierarchy detection)

#### Phase 4: Additional Domains (as needed)
- documentation-steward
- accessibility-advocate
- user-experience-contributor

### Required Safeguards (Consensus Requirements)

1. **Anti-Authority Protocols**: Explicit mechanisms preventing expertise from becoming authority
2. **Role Rotation**: Quarterly rotation of coordination responsibilities
3. **Cross-Domain Input**: Technical decisions require non-specialist consultation
4. **Hierarchy Monitoring**: Active detection and response to deference patterns
5. **Administrative Transparency**: All coordination decisions documented and challengeable

### Administrative Protocols

1. **Tiered Consultation Framework**: Scale consultation based on decision impact
2. **Parallel Consultation Tracks**: Prevent bottlenecks through simultaneous agent consultation
3. **Emergency Pathways**: Time-boxed urgent decision processes
4. **Knowledge Sharing Requirements**: Cross-domain expertise transfer

## Consensus Status: REACHED

Both agents agree on creating specialized agents with the integrated safeguards and phased implementation approach. 

**Collective Decision**: Proceed with Phase 1 agent creation implementing all agreed safeguards.
