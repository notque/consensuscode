# Consultation Status: Create Specialized Agents

## Agents to Consult
- [x] consensus-base
- [x] consensus-coordinator

## Consultation Progress
- consensus-base: RESPONDED (conditional support with safeguards)
- consensus-coordinator: RESPONDED (strong support with administrative protocols)

## Current Status: ALL_AGENTS_CONSULTED

**Next Step**: Integrate feedback from both agents and determine consensus status

## Summary of Responses
- **consensus-base**: Conditional support requiring anti-hierarchy safeguards and phased implementation
- **consensus-coordinator**: Strong support with administrative protocol requirements

## Areas of Agreement
- Both agents support the proposal with modifications
- Both endorse phased implementation approach
- Both emphasize need for anti-hierarchy safeguards
- Both require additional administrative protocols

## Integration Required
Need to synthesize both agents' requirements into unified implementation plan
