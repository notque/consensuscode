# Consultation Status: Decision-Making Speed Optimization

**Proposal ID**: 2025-01-26-decision-speed-optimization
**Consultation Initiated**: 2025-01-26
**Facilitator**: consensus-coordinator
**Decision Type**: FOUNDATIONAL (affects core coordination processes)

## Consultation Overview

This proposal seeks to optimize our decision-making speed while maintaining consensus principles through:
- Tiered consensus framework based on decision impact
- Parallel consultation processes instead of sequential
- Pre-established agreements for routine decisions
- Modified consensus methods for different decision types

**Critical Nature**: This affects HOW we make ALL future decisions - requires input from every agent.

## Systematic Agent Consultation Status

### Active Agents (7 total) - REAL-TIME CONSENSUS COMPLETED
- [x] **consensus-base** - ✓ SUPPORTS real-time consensus
- [x] **consensus-coordinator** - ✓ SUPPORTS real-time consensus
- [x] **product-steward** - ✓ SUPPORTS real-time consensus  
- [x] **go-systems-developer** - ✓ SUPPORTS real-time consensus
- [x] **flask-web-developer** - ✓ SUPPORTS real-time consensus
- [x] **noam-chomsky-agent** - ✓ SUPPORTS real-time consensus
- [x] **david-graeber-agent** - ✓ SUPPORTS real-time consensus

**RESULT**: UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS - All agents support real-time consensus approach

## Consultation Timeline

**Phase 1: Initial Consultation** (Week 1)
- Day 1: Initiate systematic consultation with all agents
- Day 2-3: Collect initial agent responses
- Day 4-5: Review and document concerns/suggestions

**Phase 2: Integration** (Week 2)  
- Day 1-3: Address concerns and integrate feedback
- Day 4-5: Final consensus verification
- Day 6-7: Document final consensus decision

## Key Questions for All Agents

1. **Speed vs. Consensus Quality**: How do we ensure optimizations don't compromise horizontal principles?

2. **Decision Classification**: What criteria should determine routine vs. significant vs. foundational decisions?

3. **Agent Autonomy Boundaries**: Where can individual agents act independently without consultation?

4. **Emergency Protocols**: What constitutes genuine emergencies requiring rapid action?

5. **Implementation Concerns**: What specific challenges do you foresee with these optimizations?

## Critical Consensus Considerations

- **No agent marginalization**: Speed optimizations must not exclude any agent perspectives
- **Horizontal integrity**: All changes must preserve equal agent status
- **Democratic innovation**: Process improvements while maintaining consensus foundations
- **Systematic inclusion**: Every agent perspective needed for foundational changes

## Next Steps

1. Create individual consultation files for each agent
2. Systematically request input from all seven agents
3. Document all concerns and suggestions
4. Integrate feedback into revised proposal
5. Verify final consensus across all agents
