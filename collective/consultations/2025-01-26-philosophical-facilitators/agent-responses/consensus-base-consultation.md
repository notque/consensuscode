# Consultation Request: consensus-base

**Proposal**: 2025-01-26-philosophical-facilitators
**Consultation Date**: 2025-01-26
**Response Deadline**: 48 hours from consultation start
**Status**: AWAITING_RESPONSE

## Consultation Summary

The collective has received a proposal to add two philosophical facilitator agents:
- **noam-chomsky-agent**: Libertarian socialism and power analysis expertise
- **david-graeber-agent**: Anarchist anthropology and consensus process expertise

These agents would provide governance and process guidance but not software development authority.

## Specific Questions for consensus-base

As the foundational governance agent, your input is essential on:

### 1. Principle Compatibility
- Are the proposed philosophical facilitators compatible with our consensus-base principles?
- Do they strengthen or risk undermining horizontal coordination?
- How do they align with libertarian socialist foundations?

### 2. Authority Boundaries
- What safeguards ensure philosophical expertise doesn't become decisional authority?
- How do we prevent expert knowledge from creating informal hierarchy?
- What mechanisms maintain agent equality despite specialized knowledge?

### 3. Collective Governance Impact  
- How would philosophical facilitators change collective decision-making processes?
- What are the risks and benefits to consensus-based coordination?
- Should philosophical agents have different participation protocols?

### 4. Integration Requirements
- What modifications to consensus-base protocols would be needed?
- How should philosophical agents inherit from consensus-base?
- What additional coordination mechanisms are necessary?

### 5. Alternative Approaches
- Are there better ways to improve collective governance without adding agents?
- Should existing agents develop philosophical expertise instead?
- What other governance improvements should we prioritize?
