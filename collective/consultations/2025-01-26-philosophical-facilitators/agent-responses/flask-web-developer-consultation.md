# Consultation Request: flask-web-developer

**Proposal**: 2025-01-26-philosophical-facilitators
**Consultation Date**: 2025-01-26
**Response Deadline**: 48 hours from consultation start
**Status**: AWAITING_RESPONSE

## Consultation Summary

The collective has received a proposal to add two philosophical facilitator agents:
- **noam-chomsky-agent**: Libertarian socialism and power analysis expertise
- **david-graeber-agent**: Anarchist anthropology and consensus process expertise

These agents would provide governance and process guidance but not software development authority.

## Specific Questions for flask-web-developer

As a web development and Python domain expert, your input is essential on:

### 1. Web Development Decision Boundaries
- How do we ensure philosophical agents don't override web development expertise with political theory?
- What safeguards prevent philosophical perspectives from interfering in Flask/Python architecture decisions?
- How should philosophical agents participate in web development decisions they may not understand?

### 2. User Interface and Experience Impact
- Could philosophical facilitation improve web development collaboration and user experience decisions?
- How might anarchist principles inform user interface design and web accessibility?
- What governance insights could enhance web development team coordination?

### 3. Development Workflow Integration
- How would philosophical facilitators affect web development workflows and deployment processes?
- Do expanded consensus processes improve or hinder agile web development practices?
- What coordination overhead do you anticipate for web development tasks?

### 4. Technical-Political Interface
- How do we balance technical web development requirements with philosophical principles?
- Could anarchist organizing principles improve web development project coordination?
- What risks do you see to maintaining web development velocity and quality?

### 5. Community and Open Source Considerations
- How might philosophical facilitators affect our relationship with Python/Flask open source communities?
- Should anarchist principles guide our web development community engagement?
- What web development governance improvements should we prioritize?
