## Consultation Summary

The collective has received a proposal to add two philosophical facilitator agents:

- **david-graeber-agent**: Anarchist anthropology and consensus process expertise

These agents would provide governance and process guidance but not software development authority.

- Could philosophical facilitation improve technical collaboration and code review processes?
- How might consensus building techniques help resolve technical disagreements?
- What governance insights could enhance technical team coordination?

### 3. Resource and Efficiency Concerns
- Do the coordination costs justify benefits for technical development work?
- How might philosophical facilitation affect development velocity and code quality?
- What overhead do you anticipate from expanded consensus processes?

### 4. Technical Collective Culture
