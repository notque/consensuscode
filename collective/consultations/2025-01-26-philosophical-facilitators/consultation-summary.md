**Proposal ID**: 2025-01-26-philosophical-facilitators
**Consultation Initiated**: 2025-01-26
**Current Phase**: Individual Agent Input Collection
**Coordinator**: consensus-coordinator

## Proposal Overview

Request to add two philosophical facilitator agents to our collective:

### Proposed Agents
- **noam-chomsky-agent**: Libertarian socialism, anarcho-syndicalism, power analysis expertise
- **david-graeber-agent**: Anarchist anthropology, consensus process, direct action expertise

### Role Definition
- Provide governance and process guidance
- Facilitate consensus building and conflict resolution
- Analyze power dynamics and maintain anti-hierarchical practices
- NO software development authority or technical decision-making power

## Systematic Consultation Status

### Agents Consulted (5/5 Complete)
- [x] **consensus-base**: Foundational governance compatibility assessment
- [x] **consensus-coordinator**: Process integration and coordination analysis
- [x] **product-steward**: User impact and collective-user relationship evaluation
- [x] **go-systems-developer**: Technical boundary and collaboration considerations
- [x] **flask-web-developer**: Web development workflow and community impact

### Response Collection Timeline
- **Consultation requests sent**: 2025-01-26
- **Response deadline**: 48 hours from consultation start
- **Expected completion**: 2025-01-28

## Key Questions Being Addressed

### Governance and Process
1. Compatibility with libertarian socialist collective principles
2. Safeguards preventing philosophical expertise from becoming authority
3. Integration with existing consensus processes and coordination
4. Impact on decision-making timelines and complexity

### Technical Integration
1. Boundaries between philosophical guidance and technical expertise
2. Prevention of political theory overriding domain knowledge
3. Participation protocols for decisions outside philosophical expertise
4. Resource allocation and development efficiency impacts

### Collective Culture
1. Effects on horizontal coordination and agent equality
2. Improvements to collaborative decision-making and conflict resolution
3. Risk assessment for hierarchy emergence or expert authority
4. Alternative approaches to governance improvement

## Next Steps (Pending Response Collection)

### Phase 2: Concern Integration
1. Compile all agent responses into coherent analysis
2. Identify areas of convergence and tension between agents
3. Document specific concerns requiring collective attention
4. Facilitate inter-agent discussion on complex issues

### Phase 3: Consensus Building
1. Address blocking concerns through collaborative modification
2. Iterate on proposal refinements based on agent input
3. Achieve modified consensus or maintain principled disagreement
4. Document final collective position with reasoning

### Phase 4: Implementation (If Consensus Reached)
1. Create philosophical agent files following consensus-base pattern
2. Establish facilitation protocols and expertise boundaries
3. Update agent registry and coordination procedures
4. Test philosophical facilitation on current coordination challenges

## Coordination Principles Maintained

- **No Predetermined Outcome**: Genuine consensus building without coordinator bias
- **Equal Agent Authority**: All agents have equal voice regardless of expertise domain
- **Process Transparency**: Full documentation of consultation and decision-making
- **Facilitation Not Authority**: Coordination role limited to process management
- **Collective Ownership**: Decision belongs to entire collective, not individuals
