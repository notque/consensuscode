# Proposal: Create Specialized Agent Collective

**Proposer**: User (via consensus process)
**Date**: 2025-01-26
**Status**: PROPOSED
**Proposal ID**: 2025-01-26-create-specialized-agents

## Problem/Need Statement
The collective currently has only the consensus-base protocol and consensus-coordinator. To effectively develop software horizontally, we need specialized agents that contribute domain expertise while maintaining equal standing in collective decisions.

- Why does this require collective input? This establishes the fundamental composition of our collective
- What happens if we don't address this? The collective cannot function for software development without diverse expertise
- Who is affected by this situation? All future collective operations depend on this foundation

## Proposed Solution
Create the following specialized agents, all inheriting consensus-base protocol:

### Core Development Agents
- **product-steward**: Facilitates user requirements gathering (NOT product owner - no authority)
- **go-systems-developer**: Contributes Go language and systems expertise
- **flask-web-developer**: Provides Python/Flask web development knowledge
- **devops-coordinator**: Coordinates infrastructure through consensus

### Quality and Security Agents  
- **security-expert**: Contributes security analysis and defensive practices
- **testing-expert**: Provides testing strategies and quality assurance expertise

### Potential Additional Agents
- **documentation-steward**: Maintains collective knowledge and onboarding materials
- **user-experience-contributor**: Focuses on usability and accessibility
- **data-systems-expert**: Handles databases and data architecture (if needed)

## Affected Agents/Areas
- [x] consensus-base (foundational - affects all agents)
- [x] consensus-coordinator (will coordinate these agents)
- [ ] All proposed new agents

## Resource Requirements
- **Computational resources**: Agent creation and coordination overhead
- **Agent time commitment**: Initial setup and ongoing coordination participation
- **External dependencies**: None for agent creation
- **Shared resources affected**: Agent registry, consultation processes, decision tracking

## Implementation Approach
1. **Create agent definition files** following consensus-base inheritance pattern
2. **Update agent registry** to include all new agents in consultation processes  
3. **Test consensus process** with new agent collective
4. **Establish initial collective agreements** about working protocols

## Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Minimal agents**: Start with just core development agents, add others later
- **Domain clustering**: Group related expertise (e.g., "quality-agent" combining testing and security)
- **Do nothing**: Continue with just consensus-coordinator (insufficient for software development)

## Open Questions
- Should we start with all proposed agents or phase them in?
- Are there other domains of expertise we're missing?
- How do we prevent any agent from becoming an informal authority figure?
- Should documentation-steward be separate or integrated into other roles?

## Timeline and Urgency
- **Urgency level**: MEDIUM (needed to proceed with development work)
- **Target implementation**: After consensus reached
- **Key deadlines**: None external
- **Dependencies on other decisions**: This enables all future development decisions
