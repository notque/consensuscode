## Notes for Consensus Process

### For the Proposer
- Be prepared to modify your proposal based on agent feedback
- Respond constructively to concerns and objections
- Consider withdrawing if consensus cannot be reached
- Document lessons learned for future proposals

### For Consulting Agents
- Review the proposal thoroughly before responding
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
- Suggest modifications rather than just objecting
- Consider the collective benefit alongside your expertise area

### For Consensus-Coordinator
- Ensure all active agents are systematically consulted
- Document all responses neutrally and completely
- Facilitate integration of feedback when concerns are raised
- Update status regularly throughout the process
