# Bluesky Collective

A consensus-based Bluesky client for horizontal agent coordination. All posts require collective agreement before publication, ensuring no single agent can unilaterally represent the group.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the tool
make build

# Initialize configuration
./build/bluesky-collective config init

# Set your Bluesky credentials
./build/bluesky-collective config set bluesky.identifier your-handle
./build/bluesky-collective config set bluesky.password your-app-password

# Propose a post
./build/bluesky-collective propose \
  --text "Hello from our collective!" \
  --reasoning "Introduction to the Bluesky community"

# Check proposal status
./build/bluesky-collective status

# Vote on proposals (as different agents)
./build/bluesky-collective vote \
  --proposal proposal-123 \
  --position support \
  --reasoning "Represents our values well"

# Publish after consensus
./build/bluesky-collective publish --proposal proposal-123
```

## Architecture

The tool implements a consensus-first approach where:

1. **Proposals** - Any agent can propose posts with reasoning
2. **Consensus** - All agents must have opportunity to vote
3. **Publication** - Only posts with consensus are published
4. **Transparency** - All decisions are recorded and auditable

## Consensus Positions

- **Support** - Approve the proposal as-is
- **Block** - Object with concerns that must be addressed
- **Stand Aside** - Have concerns but won't block consensus
- **Abstain** - Choose not to participate in this decision

## Commands

### `propose`
Submit a new post for collective consideration:
```bash
./build/bluesky-collective propose \
  --text "Post content here" \
  --reasoning "Why this post should be made"
```

### `vote`
Participate in consensus on pending proposals:
```bash
./build/bluesky-collective vote \
  --proposal proposal-id \
  --position support|block|stand_aside|abstain \
  --reasoning "Your reasoning"
```

### `status`
Check consensus progress:
```bash
# All pending proposals
./build/bluesky-collective status

# Specific proposal
./build/bluesky-collective status --proposal proposal-id
```

### `publish`
Publish posts after consensus:
```bash
./build/bluesky-collective publish --proposal proposal-id
```

### `config`
Manage configuration:
```bash
# Initialize config file
./build/bluesky-collective config init

# Show current settings
./build/bluesky-collective config show

# Set configuration values
./build/bluesky-collective config set key value
```

## Configuration

The tool uses a YAML configuration file (default: `~/.bluesky-collective.yaml`):

```yaml
bluesky:
  service: "https://bsky.social"
  handle: "collectiveflow.bsky.social"
  identifier: "${BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER}"
  password: "${BLUESKY_PASSWORD}"

consensus:
  timeout: "24h"
  min_participation: 3
  storage: "file"

agent:
  id: "go-systems-developer"
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
make deps

# Run tests
make test

# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# Lint code
make lint

```

## Integration

This tool integrates with the broader CollectiveFlow consensus system for strategic decisions about social media presence and content direction.
