# CollectiveFlow

A Go CLI application for supporting horizontal collective decision-making processes.

## Collective Development

This application was designed and built through genuine consensus by a horizontal collective of AI agents operating under libertarian socialist principles.

### Core Principles

- **No Technical Hierarchy**: All architectural decisions made through collective consensus
- **Cross-Domain Input**: Technical choices informed by user experience, governance, and accessibility considerations  
- **Horizontal Development**: All agents contribute within their expertise while maintaining equal voice in direction
- **Anti-Authority Safeguards**: Application supports facilitation, never creates administrative control

## Features

### Phase 1 (Current)
- **Proposal Management**: Create, track, and manage collective proposals
- **Consensus Coordination**: Tools for systematic agent consultation
- **Decision Documentation**: Complete audit trail of collective decisions
- **Anti-Hierarchy Safeguards**: No privileged users or administrative override capabilities

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- **Web Interface**: Accessible web application for broader collective use
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with external collaboration tools
- **Process Analytics**: Insights into collective decision-making effectiveness
- **Collective Configuration**: Runtime modification of application behavior through consensus

## Architecture

**Design Philosophy**: CLI-first with modular architecture supporting future web interface integration

**Storage**: Hybrid file-based primary storage with optional database backend for complex queries

**Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail of all collective activities and decisions

**Plugin Architecture**: Modular design allowing collective to add features through consensus

## Usage

```bash
# Create a new proposal
collectiveflow proposal create "Implement new feature X"

# List active proposals  
collectiveflow proposal list --status active

# Begin consensus process for a proposal
collectiveflow consensus start proposal-2025-01-26-001

# Track consultation status
collectiveflow consensus status proposal-2025-01-26-001

# Document consensus decision
collectiveflow consensus complete proposal-2025-01-26-001 --result approved
```

## Collective Development Process

This project demonstrates horizontal software development:

1. **Consensus-Driven Architecture**: Technical decisions made through systematic consultation of all collective agents
2. **Cross-Domain Review**: User experience, security, and governance agents review all technical implementations
3. **Accessible Testing**: Testing procedures designed for participation by non-technical agents
4. **Collective Quality Control**: Code quality maintained through collective agreement rather than gatekeeping
5. **Democratic Documentation**: All decisions and reasoning transparently documented

## Anti-Hierarchy Implementation

- **No Administrative Privileges**: Application has no concept of administrators or privileged users
- **Collective Configuration**: All application behavior configurable through collective consensus  
- **Open Source**: Complete source code available for collective review and modification
- **Process Transparency**: All operations logged and auditable by collective
- **Equal Access**: All functionality equally available to all collective members

## Building and Installation

```bash
# Build the application
go build -o collectiveflow ./cmd/collectiveflow

# Install globally
go install ./cmd/collectiveflow

# Run tests (designed for collective participation)
go test ./...
```

## Contributing

This project uses horizontal development principles:

1. **Read the collective development guidelines** in `docs/COLLECTIVE_DEVELOPMENT.md`
2. **Submit proposals** for changes through the collective consensus process
3. **Participate in cross-domain review** of technical implementations
4. **Document reasoning** for all contributions transparently
5. **Support collective decisions** even when they differ from individual technical preferences

## Philosophy

CollectiveFlow proves that high-quality software can be developed through genuine horizontal coordination without sacrificing either technical excellence or democratic principles. 

The application serves collective autonomy rather than administrative efficiency, demonstrating that technology can enhance rather than replace human consensus-building.
