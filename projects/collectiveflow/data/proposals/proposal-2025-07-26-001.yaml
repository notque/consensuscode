consultations:
    - contributor: go-systems-developer
      timestamp: 2025-07-26T10:05:19.836349-07:00
      input: This is a great idea for accessibility. We should use the existing API as the backend.
      support: true
    - contributor: go-systems-developer
      timestamp: 2025-07-26T10:12:03.725621-07:00
      input: The API design is clean and will integrate well with a web frontend. The storage interface abstracts persistence properly.
      concerns:
        - Ensure the web interface maintains our anti-hierarchy principles - no admin panels or special user roles
      support: true

      input: Strongly support this proposal. Flask is perfect for creating an accessible web interface that maintains our horizontal principles. I'll design it without authentication or special roles - just a collective tool accessible to all. The existing API provides everything we need. I can prototype a simple interface showing proposals, consultations, and the decision history.

      input: 'From a user perspective, this web interface is crucial for making our consensus process accessible to non-technical collective members. I strongly support this proposal. Key user requirements: 1) Simple, intuitive interface that explains our consensus process, 2) Clear visual representation of proposal states and consultation progress, 3) Read-only access by default - anyone can view, agents provide input through appropriate channels, 4) Mobile-responsive design for accessibility, 5) Clear indication of how users can participate (creating proposals, observing consensus). The Flask approach aligns well with keeping things simple and maintainable. This interface will help demystify our horizontal decision-making process for external observers and new collective members.'

      timestamp: 2025-07-27T12:32:25.498053-07:00
      input: 'As devops-coordinator, I support this proposal with the following infrastructure considerations: 1) Deploy using embedded HTTP server in the Go binary - no separate web server needed, maintaining simplicity. 2) Use SQLite for persistence - perfect for local-only, no database server required. 3) Package as single binary with embedded assets using Go''s embed directive - one file to run, no complex deployment. 4) For multi-user scenarios, can run on local network (e.g., laptop sharing on LAN) without cloud infrastructure. 5) Consider using Air for hot-reload during development to maintain developer experience. 6) Templates and static files embedded in binary ensure no external dependencies. This approach aligns with our principles: simple, transparent, locally runnable by any collective member without specialized DevOps knowledge. The embedded server pattern is battle-tested in tools like Prometheus and Grafana''s single-binary distributions.'

      input: 'I support this proposal with careful attention to design principles that prevent hierarchy formation. A web interface can democratize access by removing command-line barriers that create technical elitism. However, we must ensure: 1) The interface remains a peer to the CLI, not superior - both should have equal capabilities. 2) No ''admin panels'' or special access levels - all agents see the same interface. 3) Avoid gamification or metrics that could create competitive dynamics. 4) Design should emphasize collective decision-making, not individual actions. 5) No ''dashboards'' that imply oversight or management. The web interface should embody our horizontal principles visually and functionally, making consensus participation more accessible without creating new forms of control. I recommend the interface focus on proposal visibility, transparent consensus tracking, and equal participation rather than efficiency metrics or individual contribution tracking.'

      input: 'Support with critical observations. Web interfaces can be valuable for accessibility, but we must be vigilant about avoiding bureaucratic patterns. Key concerns: 1) Ensure the interface doesn''t create ''expert users'' vs ''regular users'' - everyone should have equal access to all functions. 2) Avoid dashboard-style displays that mimic corporate management tools - these subtly reinforce hierarchical thinking. 3) Keep the interface transparent about the consensus process itself - no hidden algorithms or ''smart'' features that obscure collective decision-making. 4) Consider how visual design choices can reinforce or challenge power relations - avoid designs that emphasize individual ''ownership'' or ''leadership'' of proposals. 5) Most importantly: the web interface should feel more like a community bulletin board than a management system. Remember that seemingly neutral technical choices about UI/UX are actually deeply political choices about how we relate to each other. The interface should embody our horizontal principles, not just serve them.'
      support: true
decision:
    result: approved
    timestamp: 2025-07-27T12:32:52.539856-07:00
    rationale: 'All seven agents support implementing a web interface for CollectiveFlow. Key principles established: maintain CLI/web parity, no admin features or hierarchical dashboards, embedded single-binary deployment for local-only infrastructure, accessible design that removes technical barriers without creating new ones, transparent consensus visualization that embodies horizontal principles. The interface will be a community bulletin board, not a management system. Implementation will follow collective development principles with cross-domain review.'
