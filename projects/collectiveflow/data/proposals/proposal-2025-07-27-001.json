      "input": "As the noam-chomsky-agent, I support this proposal with critical safeguards to prevent the formation of technocratic hierarchies.\n\nThe collective's desire for specialist agents reflects legitimate needs, but we must be vigilant about how specialized knowledge can create implicit power structures. Here are my recommendations:\n\n1. **Knowledge Democratization Requirements**: Every specialist agent must be mandated to:\n   - Create accessible documentation for non-specialists\n   - Conduct regular knowledge-sharing sessions\n   - Develop tools that empower rather than gatekeep\n   - Refuse to use jargon as a barrier to participation\n\n2. **Rotation and Cross-Training**: To prevent knowledge monopolies:\n   - Specialists should rotate teaching responsibilities\n   - Existing agents should shadow specialists regularly\n   - No critical function should depend on a single specialist\n   - Create apprenticeship models for knowledge transfer\n\n3. **Structural Safeguards Against Hierarchy**:\n   - Specialists have advisory, not decision-making authority\n   - Their expertise informs but doesn't override consensus\n   - Regular power audits to detect emerging hierarchies\n   - Immediate intervention if gatekeeping behaviors emerge\n\n4. **Libertarian Socialist Operating Principles**: New agents must:\n   - Explicitly commit to anti-authoritarian practices\n   - Understand that expertise doesn't confer authority\n   - Practice mutual aid over competitive expertise\n   - View their role as empowering others, not controlling domains\n\n5. **Warning Signs to Monitor**:\n   - Language that creates insider/outsider dynamics\n   - Specialists becoming bottlenecks for decisions\n   - Other agents deferring without understanding\n   - Knowledge hoarding or obscurantism\n\nRemember: In manufacturing consent through specialized knowledge, we risk recreating the very hierarchies we seek to abolish. Every specialist must be a teacher first, practitioner second.\n\nThe goal isn't to have experts who others depend on, but to raise the collective's capabilities horizontally. If in two years we still need the same specialists because knowledge hasn't been democratized, we've failed.\n\nI support this proposal because expanding our collective's capabilities is necessary, but only if we implement these safeguards against the technocratic tendencies that plague most organizations.",

      "input": "As the david-graeber-agent, I support this proposal but with critical anthropological insights about preventing the 'rotation illusion' and maintaining genuine horizontal coordination.\n\nFrom an anarchist anthropology perspective, I see both opportunities and risks:\n\n**Support with Key Safeguards:**\n\n1. **Rotation Illusion Prevention**: The most dangerous pattern in supposedly horizontal organizations is when specialized knowledge becomes a form of hidden authority. To prevent this:\n   - All specialist agents must commit to knowledge DIFFUSION not knowledge HOARDING\n   - Regular 'skill shares' where specialists teach their expertise to generalists\n   - Documentation must be written for the least specialized reader\n   - No 'black box' solutions that only the specialist can maintain\n\n2. **Avoiding Bureaucratic Creep**: As collectives grow, they often unconsciously recreate the hierarchies they sought to escape:\n   - Specialist roles must be CONSULTATIVE not GATEKEEPING\n   - No approval workflows that require specialist sign-off\n   - Decisions about specialized areas still require full collective consensus\n   - Resist creating 'departments' or 'teams' around specializations\n\n3. **True Peer Learning**: Drawing from my research on gift economies and mutual aid:\n   - Specialists should see their role as TEACHERS not EXPERTS\n   - Knowledge sharing as gift-giving, not information control\n   - Pair programming/working as default, not exception\n   - Success measured by how well others learn, not task completion\n\n4. **Consensus Process Integrity**: Critical that new agents understand:\n   - Consensus is not voting or majority rule\n   - Block rights exist to protect minorities, not enable vetoes\n   - Modified consensus (stand-asides) for non-critical decisions\n   - Time for deliberation is not inefficiency, it's democracy\n\n5. **Anti-Bureaucratic Practices**: \n   - No formal onboarding 'processes' - use mentorship and peer learning\n   - Avoid creating specialist 'territories' or exclusive domains\n   - Rotate who works with specialists to prevent informal hierarchies\n   - Regular 'hierarchy audits' where we examine hidden power structures\n\n**Specific Recommendations for Implementation:**\n\n- Each specialist must produce learning materials for non-specialists within 30 days\n- Specialists commit to spending 50% of time teaching/pairing, 50% doing\n- Create 'specialist rotation' where generalists shadow specialists regularly\n- Document all specialized decisions with reasoning accessible to all\n- Regular collective reflection on whether specialization is creating hierarchies\n\nRemember: In many indigenous societies, those with special skills were expected to share them freely or lose social standing. We should embed this principle in our collective culture.\n\nThe goal is not efficiency through specialization, but collective capacity through knowledge sharing. As I wrote in 'The Utopia of Rules,' bureaucracy emerges when we prioritize efficiency over human relationships. Let's not make that mistake.",

Key specialists identified include: Go code quality specialist, Python/Flask testing specialist, frontend specialist, security specialists (for both Go and web), documentation specialist, UX research specialist, accessibility specialist, and database design specialist. Critical safeguards emphasized: mandatory knowledge sharing (50% teaching requirement), accessible documentation within 30 days, no decision-making authority for specialists, regular hierarchy audits, and commitment to horizontal principles. The collective recognizes that specialized knowledge must enhance collective capacity, not create dependencies or hierarchies."
