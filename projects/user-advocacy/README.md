# User Advocacy Framework for Horizontal Collectives

A comprehensive toolkit for integrating authentic user voice into collective decision-making while maintaining horizontal, non-hierarchical principles.

## What This Is

This project provides concrete tools and processes for collectives that want to center user needs without falling into extractive "user research" patterns. It's designed specifically for horizontal organizations that reject traditional power hierarchies.

## Core Philosophy

- **Users as Experts**: Users are authorities on their own experience
- **Power Redistribution**: Real user agency, not just input opportunities  
- **Horizontal Engagement**: No participant holds permanent authority
- **Transparent Process**: All decision-making visible to users

## Quick Start

1. **Read**: Start with `/docs/getting-started-guide.md`
2. **Plan**: Use `/docs/implementation-checklist.md` 
3. **Act**: Begin with `/templates/user-feedback-form.md`
4. **Learn**: Iterate based on user feedback

## Key Features

### Horizontal by Design
- No permanent hierarchy in user engagement
- Users co-facilitate and co-design processes
- Power analysis and redistribution built-in
- Collective accountability to user communities

### Practical and Actionable
- Ready-to-use templates and tools
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Real-world examples and scenarios
- Failure modes and recovery strategies

### User-Centered Throughout
- Users validate all "translations" of their input
- Multiple accessibility accommodations
- Cultural and linguistic sensitivity
- Economic barriers actively addressed

## Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation** (Week 1-4): Basic setup and first user contact
2. **Relationship Building** (Week 2-6): Trust and communication patterns
3. **Integration Testing** (Week 4-8): First decision with user input
4. **Workshop Development** (Week 6-12): Collective user engagement
5. **Systematic Implementation** (Month 3-6): Regular process integration
6. **Evaluation and Improvement** (Month 4-12): Ongoing refinement

## When to Use This Framework

### Good Fit
- Collectives committed to horizontal organizing
- Projects with identifiable user communities
- Organizations wanting to redistribute decision power
- Groups willing to slow down for authentic engagement

### Challenging Fit
- Hierarchical organizations unwilling to share power
- Projects with no clear user community
- Groups under extreme time pressure
- Organizations with significant internal conflict

## Success Indicators

- Users initiate contact and proposals
- Diverse user voices participating regularly
- User-defined success metrics being met
- Trust levels between users and collective increasing
- Measurable power redistribution occurring

## Common Challenges

### User Fatigue
**Symptoms**: Declining participation, superficial engagement
**Solutions**: Fair compensation, limited meeting frequency, multiple engagement options

### Technical Domination  
**Symptoms**: Complex language, user silence, assumption of expertise
**Solutions**: Plain language requirements, user co-facilitation, power mapping

### Tokenistic Participation
**Symptoms**: Users present but not influential, predetermined outcomes
**Solutions**: User agenda-setting power, transparent criteria, external advocacy

## Getting Help

### Learning Resources
- Community organizing training
- Facilitation skill workshops  
- Anti-oppression education
- Consensus decision-making courses

### Community Support
- Other horizontal collectives practicing user advocacy
- User advocacy practitioners and ombudspeople
- Community organizers and facilitators
- Academic researchers on participatory democracy

## Contributing

This framework is designed to evolve based on collective experience. To contribute:

1. **Use the tools** and document your experience
2. **Gather user feedback** on the framework itself
3. **Share modifications** that work in your context
4. **Report challenges** and proposed solutions

### Types of Contributions Needed
- Case studies from real implementations
- Cultural adaptations for different communities
- Accessibility improvements and accommodations
- Integration with other horizontal organizing tools

## Principles for Contributors

- **Users First**: All improvements should serve user agency
- **Horizontal Process**: Contributions reviewed through consensus
- **Transparent Development**: All discussions and decisions visible
- **Accessible Output**: Materials usable by non-experts

## Relationship to Broader Collective

This User Advocacy Framework was developed as part of the Consensus Code collective, which experiments with applying libertarian socialist principles to AI agent coordination. It represents one agent's contribution to ensuring user voices drive collective decisions.

### Collective Integration
- Developed through systematic agent consultation
- User-validated through iterative feedback
- Integrated with collective decision-making processes
- Supported by all agents in the horizontal collective

## License and Usage

This framework is provided for use by any collective committed to horizontal organizing and authentic user engagement. It is specifically designed for non-hierarchical organizations and may not work well in traditional power structures.

### Attribution
When adapting this framework, please acknowledge both the Consensus Code collective and any users who contributed to its development in your context.

## Questions?

For questions about implementation or adaptation:
- Review the `/docs/getting-started-guide.md` for common scenarios
- Use the `/docs/implementation-checklist.md` for systematic adoption
- Connect with other collectives using similar approaches
- Most importantly: ask your users what they need

Remember: The best user advocacy framework is the one your users help you create.
