## Quick Start for Collectives

This guide helps collectives begin implementing user advocacy practices immediately while building toward the full framework.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] Collective has committed to horizontal principles
- [ ] Product Steward role is understood as non-hierarchical
- [ ] Basic consensus process is established
- [ ] Communication infrastructure exists

### Initial Mindset Shifts
- **From "user requirements" to "user expertise"**
- **From "gathering feedback" to "redistributing power"**  
- **From "serving users" to "following user leadership"**
- **From "user research" to "relationship building"**

---

## Week 1: Foundation

### Day 1-2: User Identification
**Goal**: Map who your collective actually affects

**Activities**:
1. Use the Stakeholder Mapping Tool (basic version)
2. List everyone who:
   - Uses your products/services
   - Is affected by your decisions  
   - Should have input but doesn't
   - Has tried to give input but was ignored

**Output**: Initial stakeholder list with contact information

### Day 3-4: First Contact
**Goal**: Reach out to 3-5 users for initial relationship building

**Activities**:
1. Choose users from different categories (primary, secondary, affected communities)
2. Send simple message: "We want to better understand your experience and needs"
3. Offer multiple ways to connect (phone, email, in-person, video)
4. Be honest about what you're learning to do

**Output**: Scheduled conversations with real users

### Day 5-7: Initial Conversations
**Goal**: Listen to users without agenda

**Activities**:
1. Use Stakeholder Interview Guide (simplified version)
2. Focus on these questions:
   - "What has your experience been with our work?"
   - "What do you need that you're not getting?"
   - "How would you like to be involved in decisions that affect you?"
3. Take notes but don't make promises yet

**Output**: Initial user insights and relationship foundation

---

## Week 2-3: First Feedback Cycle

### User Feedback Collection
**Goal**: Gather input using user advocacy principles

**Activities**:
1. Choose one decision your collective needs to make
2. Use User Feedback Form Template
3. Ask users specifically about this decision
4. Offer multiple ways to provide input (written, spoken, anonymous)

**Key Questions**:
- How would this decision affect you?
- What alternatives should we consider?  
- What would you propose instead?
- How do you want to be involved in deciding?

### Translation to Proposals
**Goal**: Turn user input into actionable collective proposals

**Activities**:
1. Review all user input for common themes
2. Create proposals that directly address user requests
3. **Validate translations with users** - crucial step
4. Modify proposals based on user feedback

**Output**: User-validated proposals ready for consensus

---

## Week 4: First Consensus Integration

### Preparation
**Goal**: Set up consensus process to center user voice

**Activities**:
1. Designate someone to advocate specifically for user interests
2. Share user input with all agents before consensus
3. Include user quotes and context in materials
4. Plan how to communicate decisions back to users

### Consensus Process
**Goal**: Make decisions that serve user needs

**Key Practices**:
- Start consensus discussion with user needs review
- Use Consensus Integration Tracker
- Require user advocate input on all modifications
- Document rationale for any changes from user requests

### User Communication
**Goal**: Close the feedback loop transparently

**Activities**:
1. Contact all users who provided input
2. Explain what was decided and why
3. Acknowledge where user input was/wasn't incorporated
4. Ask for feedback on the decision-making process

---

## Month 2: Workshop Planning

### Preparation
**Goal**: Plan first user-led workshop

**Activities**:
1. Invite 3-5 users to co-plan workshop
2. Use Workshop Planning Guide
3. Focus on one specific issue users have raised
4. Ensure accessible venue and timing

### Workshop Facilitation
**Goal**: Create space for collective user input

**Key Practices**:
- Users help set agenda
- Multiple facilitation styles
- Focus on proposal development
- Document everything transparently

### Follow-up
**Goal**: Integrate workshop outcomes into collective process

**Activities**:
1. Share workshop summary with all participants
2. Bring user proposals to collective consensus
3. Plan implementation with user involvement
4. Schedule regular check-ins

---

## Month 3: Systematic Integration

### Process Development
**Goal**: Build user advocacy into regular collective operations

**Activities**:
1. Schedule regular user feedback cycles
2. Include user impact assessment in all proposals
3. Create user communication schedule
4. Establish user role in implementation

### Relationship Building
**Goal**: Deepen user-collective partnerships

**Activities**:
1. Support user-led initiatives
2. Share resources based on user priorities  
3. Facilitate connections between users
4. Ask users how to improve the relationship

### Process Evaluation
**Goal**: Learn and improve user advocacy approach

**Activities**:
1. Ask users to evaluate the process
2. Reflect on power dynamics and changes
3. Identify what's working and what isn't
4. Plan improvements for next quarter

## Common Early Mistakes

### 1. Moving Too Fast
**Problem**: Rushing to "get user input" without building relationships
**Solution**: Invest time in genuine relationship building first

### 2. Predetermined Outcomes
**Problem**: Asking users to validate decisions already made
**Solution**: Involve users in problem definition and solution development

### 3. One-and-Done Engagement
**Problem**: Collecting feedback once and disappearing
**Solution**: Build ongoing communication and relationship

### 4. Expert Interpretation
**Problem**: "Translating" user needs through expert lens
**Solution**: Have users validate all translations and modifications

### 5. Ignoring Power Dynamics
**Problem**: Treating all input equally regardless of who's affected
**Solution**: Prioritize voices of those most impacted by decisions

## Quick Wins to Build Momentum

### Week 1 Wins
- First genuine user conversation
- Initial stakeholder map
- One user-requested change implemented

### Month 1 Wins  
- User input integrated into real decision
- Users report feeling heard
- Collective learns something surprising from users

### Quarter 1 Wins
- Users propose initiatives collectively supports
- Multiple user voices in decision-making
- Improved user experience from collective changes

## Warning Signs to Watch For

### User Fatigue
- Declining participation in feedback requests
- Superficial or rushed responses
- Users saying "you never listen anyway"

**Response**: Slow down, compensate fairly, prove responsiveness

### Collective Resistance
- Agents skipping user consultation steps
- "Users don't understand" justifications
- User input ignored in practice

**Response**: Return to consensus on user advocacy commitment

### Tokenistic Participation
- Same few users always consulted
- User input requested but not used
- Users present but not influential

**Response**: Expand outreach, guarantee user agency in outcomes
