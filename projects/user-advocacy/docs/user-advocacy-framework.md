# User Advocacy Framework for Horizontal Collectives

## Overview

This framework ensures user voices are central to collective decisions while maintaining horizontal, non-hierarchical principles. It provides concrete tools and processes for authentic user engagement that redistributes power rather than extracting feedback.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Users as Experts
Users are the ultimate authorities on their own experiences and needs. Our role is to create conditions for them to share expertise, not interpret it for them.

### 2. Horizontal Engagement
No participant holds permanent authority over others. Users and collective members engage as equals with different but equally valuable knowledge.

### 3. Power Redistribution
Every interaction either reinforces or challenges existing power dynamics. We choose to redistribute decision-making power to those most affected by outcomes.

### 4. Authentic Agency
Users have real influence over outcomes, not just input opportunities. Their proposals drive collective decisions, not the other way around.

### 5. Transparent Process
All aspects of decision-making are visible to users. They understand how their input is used and have recourse when it's not.

   - Regular feedback collection cycles
   - Accessible formats and languages

3. **Build Initial Relationships**
   - Direct outreach to affected communities
   - Participation in user-led spaces
   - Support for user-identified priorities

### Phase 2: Deep Engagement (Quarterly)
1. **Facilitated User Workshops**
   - User-driven agenda setting
   - Collective proposal development
   - Relationship building among users

2. **Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Power mapping exercises
   - Engagement strategy development
   - Gap identification and outreach

3. **Journey Mapping**
   - Understanding full user experience
   - Identifying pain points and opportunities
   - Developing user-centered solutions

### Phase 3: Consensus Integration (Per Decision)
1. **Proposal Development**
   - Translate user themes to actionable proposals
   - Validate translations with users
   - Ensure user agency in proposal refinement

2. **Collective Consultation**
   - Systematic agent consultation
   - User advocate role in consensus process
   - Transparent communication of any modifications

3. **User Communication**
   - Clear communication of decisions
   - Rationale for any changes from original requests
   - Plans for implementation and user role

### Phase 4: Implementation Support (Ongoing)
1. **User-Centered Implementation**
   - User involvement in implementation planning
   - Support resources for user participation
   - Regular check-ins and adjustment opportunities

2. **Impact Monitoring**
   - User-defined success metrics
   - Regular feedback on implementation
   - Course correction based on user experience

3. **Relationship Maintenance**
   - Ongoing communication with users
   - Support for user-led initiatives
   - Strengthening of user networks

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Product Steward (Non-Hierarchical)
- **Primary Function**: Facilitate user voice integration
- **Key Activities**:
  - Coordinate user feedback collection
  - Facilitate user workshops
  - Advocate for user interests in consensus
  - Maintain stakeholder relationships

- **Power Limitations**:
  - Cannot make decisions on behalf of users
  - Cannot override collective consensus
  - Cannot speak for users without permission

### All Collective Agents
- **Shared Responsibilities**:
  - Participate in user feedback processes
  - Consider user impact in all proposals
  - Support user agency and decision power
  - Contribute skills to user-identified priorities

### External User Advocates (Optional)
- **Role**: Provide independent user advocacy
- **Selection**: Chosen by users, not collective
- **Function**: Ensure user interests aren't compromised

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- Product Steward time (approximately 20% effort)
- Agent participation in user processes (estimated 10% each)
- User compensation for participation
- External facilitation support as needed

### Material Resources
- Workshop venue and accessibility accommodations
- Translation and interpretation services
- Childcare and transportation support
- Technology platforms for remote participation
- Documentation and communication tools

### Financial Resources
- User stipends for participation
- Accessibility accommodation costs
- Facilitation and support service fees
- Travel and venue costs
- Technology and platform subscriptions

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: User Fatigue
**Symptoms**: Declining participation, rushed feedback, superficial engagement
**Solutions**: 
- Compensate users fairly for time
- Limit meeting frequency and duration
- Provide multiple engagement options
- Build user capacity for self-organization

### Challenge: Technical Domination
**Symptoms**: Complex language, assumption of technical knowledge, user silence
**Solutions**:
- Plain language requirements
- User co-facilitation
- Technical translation support
- Power mapping and redistribution

### Challenge: Consensus Without Users
**Symptoms**: Decisions made in user absence, user concerns ignored, implementation problems
**Solutions**:
- Required user advocate in consensus
- User validation of all proposals
- Implementation pause for user input
- Regular process audits

### Challenge: Tokenistic Participation
**Symptoms**: Users present but not influential, predetermined outcomes, limited agenda control
**Solutions**:
- User agenda-setting power
- Transparent decision criteria
- User evaluation of process
- External advocacy support
