# User-Centered Facilitation Handbook

## Core Principles

### User as Expert
Users are experts on their own experience. Our role is to create conditions for them to share that expertise, not to interpret it for them.

### Facilitation as Service
Facilitators serve the group's needs, not their own agenda. We create structure so others can lead.

### Power Redistribution
Every facilitation choice either reinforces or challenges existing power dynamics. Choose redistribution.

### Process Transparency
Make the invisible visible. Explain why we use certain techniques and invite modification.

## Facilitation Mindset

### Before You Begin
- **Check Your Assumptions**: What do you expect to happen?
- **Examine Your Power**: How might your identity affect dynamics?
- **Center User Agency**: How can users drive the agenda?
- **Prepare to Adapt**: Plans will change - be ready

### During Facilitation
- **Listen More Than Talk**: Aim for 70% listening, 30% speaking
- **Notice Who's Not Speaking**: Make space for quiet voices
- **Track Energy**: Adjust process when energy shifts
- **Stay Curious**: Ask questions rather than making statements

### After Facilitation
- **Reflect on Power**: What dynamics emerged?
- **Seek Feedback**: How did participants experience your facilitation?
- **Document Learning**: What will you do differently next time?
- **Follow Through**: Your relationship with participants continues

## Essential Techniques

### 1. Opening Circles
**Purpose**: Build community, share power, set agreements
**Time**: 15-30 minutes depending on group size
**Process**:
- Invite people to share name, pronouns, and one-word feeling
- Ask "What do you need to feel safe/heard in this space?"
- Create group agreements together
- Acknowledge land/territory you're on

**Example Opening**: "Welcome everyone. We're going to start by creating this space together. I'm [name], using [pronouns], and I'm feeling [word]. Let's go around and hear from everyone..."

### 2. Power Mapping
**Purpose**: Make visible who has what kind of power
**Time**: 20-30 minutes
**Materials**: Large paper, sticky notes, markers

**Process**:
1. "Let's map who has power to influence [specific issue]"
2. Draw concentric circles: inner = high power, outer = low power
3. Have group place stakeholders on map
4. Discuss: "Where are users on this map? Where should they be?"

### 3. Think-Pair-Share
**Purpose**: Include introverts, reduce pressure, build ideas
**Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Process**:
1. Think (2 min): Individual reflection on question
2. Pair (5 min): Share with one other person
3. Share (8 min): Pairs report themes to large group

### 4. Listening Labs
**Purpose**: Deep listening practice, story collection
**Time**: 45-60 minutes
**Process**:
1. Form pairs (1 listener, 1 storyteller)
2. Round 1 (15 min): Storyteller shares uninterrupted
3. Round 2 (15 min): Listener reflects what they heard
4. Switch roles, repeat
5. Full group: Harvest themes

### 5. Consensus Building Rounds
**Purpose**: Move from ideas to decisions
**Time**: Variable
**Process**:
1. **Clarification**: "Do we all understand the proposal?"
2. **Concerns**: "What worries you about this?"
3. **Modifications**: "How could we address those concerns?"
4. **Test**: "Can you live with this proposal?"

## Managing Difficult Dynamics

### When Someone Dominates
- "Thank you [name]. Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet."
- Use structured formats (e.g., 2-minute max per person)
- Create "step up, step back" agreement
- Talk privately during break

### When Conflict Emerges
- **Don't Rush**: Let tension exist, it often holds important information
- **Get Specific**: "Can you give us a specific example?"
- **Find Common Ground**: "What do you both care about here?"
- **Invite Mediation**: "Would you like help working through this?"

### When Energy Drops
- **Take a Break**: Bodies need rest
- **Change Format**: From sitting to standing, large to small groups
- **Check Relevance**: "Is this topic serving everyone?"
- **Invite Movement**: Literal movement often shifts energy

### When People Are Quiet
- **Don't Force**: Create opportunities, don't pressure
- **Use Anonymous Methods**: Post-it notes, digital polls
- **Create Small Groups**: Easier to speak in groups of 3-4
- **Check Privately**: "How are you experiencing this?"

### When You Make Mistakes
- **Own It Quickly**: "I realize I just interrupted. I'm sorry."
- **Ask for Help**: "I'm feeling lost. What would be helpful right now?"
- **Learn Publicly**: "This isn't working. Let's try something else."
- **Follow Up**: Check with affected people during break

## Specific Techniques for User Advocacy

### 1. Stakeholder Voice Method
Have participants literally speak from stakeholder perspectives:
- "Speaking as a user, I need..."
- "As someone affected by this decision, I propose..."
- Switch roles every 15 minutes

### 2. Anti-Oppression Rounds
Explicitly address power differences:
- "Let's hear first from people who are most affected by this"
- "People with decision-making power, please listen first"
- Use identity caucuses for sensitive topics

### 3. Future Press Conference
Imagine implementing proposals and facing public questions:
- "It's one year from now and this is working. What questions would users ask?"
- "What would critics say? How would we respond?"
- "What stories would users tell about the change?"

### 4. Appreciation Before Critique
Build on strengths before identifying problems:
- "What's working well that we want to keep?"
- "What are users already doing right?"
- "How can we build on existing successes?"

## Language That Centers Users

### Instead of This → Try This
- "Our users need..." → "What do you need?"
- "We should educate users..." → "What information would be helpful?"
- "Users don't understand..." → "How can we explain this better?"
- "This is too complicated for users..." → "How can we simplify this?"
- "Users aren't participating..." → "What barriers exist to participation?"

### Questions That Invite User Leadership
- "What would you like to see change?"
- "What's missing from this conversation?"
- "How could this work better for you?"
- "What would you like us to know?"
- "How can we support what you're already doing?"

## Adapting to Different Groups

### New Participants
- Extra time for introductions
- Explain processes clearly
- Pair with experienced participants
- Check understanding frequently

### Technical Audiences
- Ground abstract concepts in user stories
- Ask for plain language translations
- Use analogies and examples
- Remind about non-technical participants

### Cross-Cultural Groups
- Learn basic cultural norms in advance
- Ask about communication preferences
- Allow for different discussion styles
- Provide translation when needed

### Mixed Power Groups
- Separate caucuses for different roles
- Have power-holders listen first
- Use anonymous input methods
- Address elephant in room directly
