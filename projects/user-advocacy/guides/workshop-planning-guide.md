# User Advocacy Workshop Planning Guide

## Purpose
This guide helps plan workshops that genuinely center user voices and maintain horizontal participation principles.

---

## Pre-Planning Phase

### 1. Identify the Need
- What user feedback or patterns prompted this workshop?
- Which user groups are most affected?
- What decisions need user input?

### 2. Form Planning Committee
- Include 2-3 users in planning (compensate if needed)
- Include 1-2 collective members
- Rotate planning responsibilities

### 3. Define Success Metrics
Not attendance numbers, but:
- Users feel heard
- Concrete proposals emerge
- Power imbalances addressed
- Next steps are clear

---

## Workshop Design Principles

### Horizontal Facilitation
- **Rotating Facilitators**: Multiple people share facilitation
- **User Co-Facilitators**: Pair collective members with users
- **No Expertise Hierarchy**: All knowledge valued equally
- **Distributed Documentation**: Multiple note-takers

### Accessible Design
- **Multiple Formats**: Visual, verbal, written options
- **Language Support**: Translation/interpretation as needed
- **Physical Access**: Wheelchair accessible, close to transit
- **Economic Access**: Provide stipends, childcare, meals
- **Time Access**: Vary meeting times, offer multiple sessions

### Power Redistribution
- **Agenda Setting**: Users shape agenda, not just respond
- **Speaking Order**: Prioritize voices usually unheard
- **Decision Methods**: Use consensus, not voting
- **Resource Control**: Users influence budget/resource decisions

## Facilitation Techniques

### For Including All Voices
- **Think-Pair-Share**: Individual reflection first
- **Anonymous Input**: Digital polls, written cards
- **Small Groups**: Max 5-6 for intimate discussion
- **Artistic Expression**: Drawing, movement, music
- **Storytelling Circles**: Personal narratives valued

### For Addressing Power
- **Stack Keeping**: Prioritize marginalized voices
- **Progressive Stack**: Those who haven't spoken go first
- **Caucuses**: Identity-based groups meet separately
- **Power Mapping**: Make invisible power visible
- **Direct Support**: Advocates for quiet voices

### For Building Consensus
- **Fist-to-Five**: Visual consensus checking
- **Gradients of Agreement**: Not just yes/no
- **Concerns vs Blocks**: Distinguish levels
- **Modification Rounds**: Iterate proposals
- **Synthesis Teams**: Merge similar ideas

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Extraction Without Action
- **Problem**: Gather feedback but don't act
- **Solution**: Commit to specific follow-up

### 2. Tokenization
- **Problem**: Include users for appearance
- **Solution**: Give real decision power

### 3. Expert Domination
- **Problem**: Technical folks over-explain
- **Solution**: Enforce equal time limits

### 4. Preset Outcomes
- **Problem**: Steering toward predetermined result
- **Solution**: Be genuinely open to user direction

### 5. One-Time Engagement
- **Problem**: Single workshop with no follow-up
- **Solution**: Build ongoing relationships
